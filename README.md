# LAB 02

## About-me

At the end of this lab, this webpage will provide various information about me as well as demonstrate the concepts we have learned in our readings and lectures up to this point. 

Oh, and it will have some fun pictures and snappy wordplay. I did say it would be about ME after all.

### Reflections and Comments
#### Lab 02
I am really proud of the plan I came up with for looping through arrays to ask and answer my questions. I also did a ton of work in CSS during this lab, and both learned a ton about various features of CSS and also came out with a product I am pretty happy with. 
#### Lab 03 
A little more code for the sake of assignment here, but it went pretty smoothly, the Javascript especially.
